# vagrant-ethereum-dev
Uses Vagrant to build an Ubuntu 16.04 development environment for playing with Ethereum and smart contracts. See the Vagrantfile and bootstrap.sh for more details.

Obviously, you'll need to have Vagrant installed and a hypervisor such as Virtualbox.

To use it
---------
First install on your Windows/Mac/Linux Vagrant.  

I personally installed a VM of ubuntu, this way I can easily after doing "sudo apt-get install vagrant" then do the steps below
--------
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install vagrant
git clone https://github.com/iluvpcs/vagrant-ethereum-dev
cd vagrant-ethereum-dev
(Change the static ip of 192.168.10.11 to something else in the Vagrantfile if that address is taken.)
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
solc, truffle, ganache-cli, geth, (...)  will be available to you... have fun!
```

The Vagrantfile is configured to map /home/vagrant/contracts in the guest vm to ../contracts on your host. If you want to play with Web3, the guest is running nginx as a web server on port 80 and maps /var/www/html to ../web on your host.
